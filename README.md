# Introduction
The Misfit Investment Agency (MIA) has commissioned us to build a travel community, code-named Project Wayfarer, for users to share tips about their favorite locations around the world. You will be competing for the investment, and your instructional team will act as Project Managers for your groups while you work with the MIA clients to determine the direction of the project.

# Front End

## Initial Design
Since the client's request we're vague, we decided to take our first swing at a design that very typical travel website that touched on notes of inspirational, wedding type feel that used an off-salmon pink as the primary color.

## Final Design
The client requested less pink, white and more blues. She also hinted at historical/local vibe, with a design similar to that of a baby shower. And of course, more organic. This is stumped our team, but the mash-up of themes ended up getting approved by our client.
